## Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 4 Neural Network Learning

#  Instructions
#  ------------
#
#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions
#  in this exericse:
#
#     sigmoidGradient.py
#     randInitializeWeights.py
#     nnCostFunction.py
#
#  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
#  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

import os

# Scientific and vector computation for python
import numpy as np

# Plotting library
from matplotlib import pyplot

# Optimization module in scipy
from scipy import optimize

# will be used to load MATLAB mat datafile format
from scipy.io import loadmat

# library written for this exercise providing additional functions for assignment submission, and others
import utils
import nnCostFunction
import sigmoidGradient
import randInitializeWeights

# tells matplotlib to embed plots within the notebook
#matplotlib inline

## Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  # 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25;   # 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          # 10 labels, from 1 to 10
                          # (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

## =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset.
#  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
#

# Load Training Data
print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

#  training data stored in arrays X, y
data = loadmat('ex4data1.mat')
X, y = data['X'], data['y'].ravel()

# set the zero digit to 0, rather than its mapped 10 in this dataset
# This is an artifact due to the fact that this dataset was used in
# MATLAB where there is no index 0
y[y == 10] = 0

# Number of training examples
m = y.size

# Randomly select 100 data points to display

# Randomly select 100 data points to display
rand_indices = np.random.choice(m, 100, replace=False)
sel = X[rand_indices, :]

utils.displayData(sel)


## ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
# In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized
# neural network parameters.

print('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

# Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
weights = loadmat('ex4weights.mat')

# Theta1 has size 25 x 401
# Theta2 has size 10 x 26
Theta1, Theta2 = weights['Theta1'], weights['Theta2']

# swap first and last columns of Theta2, due to legacy from MATLAB indexing,
# since the weight file ex3weights.mat was saved based on MATLAB indexing
Theta2 = np.roll(Theta2, 1, axis=0)

# Unroll parameters
nn_params = np.concatenate([Theta1.ravel(), Theta2.ravel()])

## ================ Part 3: Compute Cost (Feedforward) ================
#  To the neural network, you should first start by implementing the
#  feedforward part of the neural network that returns the cost only. You
#  should complete the code in nnCostFunction.m to return cost. After
#  implementing the feedforward to compute the cost, you can verify that
#  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
#  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.
#
#  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
#  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, in part 4, you
#  will get to implement the regularized cost.
#
print('\nFeedforward Using Neural Network ...\n')

# Weight regularization parameter (we set this to 0 here).
lambda_ = 0;

J, _ = nnCostFunction.nnCost(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size,
                   num_labels, X, y, lambda_)
print('Cost at parameters (loaded from ex4weights): %.6f ' % J)
print('The cost should be about                   : 0.287629.')

## =============== Part 4: Implement Regularization ===============
#  Once your cost function implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization with the cost.
#

print('\nChecking Cost Function (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

# Weight regularization parameter (we set this to 1 here).
lambda_ = 1;

J, _ = nnCostFunction.nnCost(nn_params, input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size,
                      num_labels, X, y, lambda_)

print('Cost at parameters (loaded from ex4weights): %.6f' % J)
print('This value should be about                 : 0.383770.')

## ================ Part 5: Sigmoid Gradient  ================
#  Before you start implementing the neural network, you will first
#  implement the gradient for the sigmoid function. You should complete the
#  code in the sigmoidGradient.m file.
#

print('\nEvaluating sigmoid gradient...\n')


z = np.array([-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1])
g = sigmoidGradient.sigGrad(z)
print('Sigmoid gradient evaluated at [-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1]:\n  ')
print(g)

## ================ Part 6: Initializing Pameters ================
#  In this part of the exercise, you will be starting to implment a two
#  layer neural network that classifies digits. You will start by
#  implementing a function to initialize the weights of the neural network
#  (randInitializeWeights.m)

print('\nInitializing Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

initial_Theta1 = randInitializeWeights.randInitWt(input_layer_size, hidden_layer_size)
initial_Theta2 = randInitializeWeights.randInitWt(hidden_layer_size, num_labels)

# Unroll parameters
initial_nn_params = np.concatenate([initial_Theta1.ravel(), initial_Theta2.ravel()], axis=0)

## =============== Part 7: Implement Backpropagation ===============
#  Once your cost matches up with ours, you should proceed to implement the
#  backpropagation algorithm for the neural network. You should add to the
#  code you've written in nnCostFunction.m to return the partial
#  derivatives of the parameters.
#
print('\nChecking Backpropagation... \n');

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients

utils.checkNNGradients(nnCostFunction.nnCost)

## =============== Part 8: Implement Regularization ===============
#  Once your backpropagation implementation is correct, you should now
#  continue to implement the regularization with the cost and gradient.
#

print('\nChecking Backpropagation (w/ Regularization) ... \n')

#  Check gradients by running checkNNGradients
lambda_ = 3
utils.checkNNGradients(nnCostFunction.nnCost, lambda_)

# Also output the costFunction debugging values
debug_J, _  = nnCostFunction.nnCost(nn_params, input_layer_size,
                          hidden_layer_size, num_labels, X, y, lambda_)

print('\n\nCost at (fixed) debugging parameters (w/ lambda = %f): %f ' % (lambda_, debug_J))
print('(for lambda = 3, this value should be about 0.576051)')

## =================== Part 8: Training NN ===================
#  You have now implemented all the code necessary to train a neural
#  network. To train your neural network, we will now use "fmincg", which
#  is a function which works similarly to "fminunc". Recall that these
#  advanced optimizers are able to train our cost functions efficiently as
#  long as we provide them with the gradient computations.
#
print('\nTraining Neural Network... \n')


#  After you have completed the assignment, change the MaxIter to a larger
#  value to see how more training helps.
options= {'maxiter': 200}

#  You should also try different values of lambda
lambda_ = 1;

# Create "short hand" for the cost function to be minimized
costFunction = lambda p: nnCostFunction.nnCost(p, input_layer_size,
                                        hidden_layer_size,
                                        num_labels, X, y, lambda_)

# Now, costFunction is a function that takes in only one argument (the
# neural network parameters)
res = optimize.minimize(costFunction,
                        initial_nn_params,
                        jac=True,
                        method='TNC',
                        options=options)

# get the solution of the optimization
nn_params = res.x

# Obtain Theta1 and Theta2 back from nn_params
Theta1 = np.reshape(nn_params[:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)],
                    (hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1)))

Theta2 = np.reshape(nn_params[(hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)):],
                    (num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1)))

## ================= Part 9: Visualize Weights =================
#  You can now "visualize" what the neural network is learning by
#  displaying the hidden units to see what features they are capturing in
#  the data.

print('\nVisualizing Neural Network... \n')

utils.displayData(Theta1[:, 1:])

## ================= Part 10: Implement Predict =================
#  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
#  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
#  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
#  you compute the training set accuracy.

pred = utils.predict(Theta1, Theta2, X)

print('Training Set Accuracy: %f' % (np.mean(pred == y) * 100))
