def randInitWt(L_in, L_out, epsilon_init=0.12):
    """
    Randomly initialize the weights of a layer in a neural network.

    Parameters
    ----------
    L_in : int
        Number of incomming connections.

    L_out : int
        Number of outgoing connections.

    epsilon_init : float, optional
        Range of values which the weight can take from a uniform
        distribution.

    Returns
    -------
    W : array_like
        The weight initialiatized to random values.  Note that W should
        be set to a matrix of size(L_out, 1 + L_in) as
        the first column of W handles the "bias" terms.

    Instructions
    ------------
    Initialize W randomly so that we break the symmetry while training
    the neural network. Note that the first column of W corresponds
    to the parameters for the bias unit.

    # You need to return the following variables correctly
    W = np.zeros((L_out, 1 + L_in))

    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================

    W = np.random.rand(L_out, 1 + L_in) * 2 * epsilon_init - epsilon_init

    return W
